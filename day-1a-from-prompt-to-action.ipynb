It aims to make agent development more akin to traditional software development, offering precise control over agent behavior and orchestration. While optimized for Google's Gemini models and Vertex AI, ADK is model-agnostic and compatible with other frameworks.

This assignment helped me understand how agents go beyond simple LLM prompts and bring real reasoning + action capabilities into applications.\n\n🔍 Importing ADK Components\n\nI began by importing the required components from the ADK and Generative AI library. This ensures clean, modular code and gives access to all the essential building blocks needed to design intelligent agents.\n\n🤖 What Exactly Is an AI Agent?\n\nWhile traditional LLMs simply take a prompt and return text, an AI Agent is different. It can think, take actions, and observe results before generating a final answer.\nPrompt → Agent → Thought → Action → Observation → Final Answer\n\nThis allows the agent to produce smarter, more accurate responses.\n\n🛠️ Defining My Agent\n\nI configured the agent with key parameters:\n\nName & Description – to identify the agent’s purpose\n\nModel – used gemini-2.5-flash-lite for efficient reasoning\n\nInstruction – the guiding prompt that defines the agent’s behavior\n\nTools – enabled the google_search tool so the agent can access real-time information\n\n🎉 Final Result\n\nI successfully built and ran the agent. The most exciting part was seeing it reason about what information it needed and automatically use tools to find answers. This highlighted the true strength of agent-based AI—not just responding, but acting.\n\nThis project gave me a solid foundation in AI Agent development, and I’m excited to keep exploring what’s possible with ADK!","metadata":{}}]}
