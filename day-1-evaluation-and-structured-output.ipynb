You also read it stories and tell it about all sorts of things. The computer brain also gets to see and read lots of things – millions and millions of pictures, books, and websites!\n\n2.  **Learning Patterns:** The puppy starts to notice patterns. It learns that things with pointy ears and a tail are often dogs, and that when you say \"sit,\" it should put its bottom on the ground. The computer brain also learns patterns. It learns that certain words often go together, and that certain pictures are related to certain words.\n\n3.  **Making Predictions:** Now, you ask the puppy a question, like \"Where's the ball?\" The puppy tries to guess where the ball is based on what it has learned. The computer brain also tries to guess the answer to questions.\n\n4.  **Getting Feedback:** If the puppy guesses right, you give it a treat and say \"Good job!\" If it guesses wrong, you gently correct it. The computer brain also gets feedback. If it guesses right, it gets a little reward. If it guesses wrong, it adjusts itself to try to guess better next time.\n\n5.  **Repeating and Improving:** You keep showing the puppy things, asking questions, and giving feedback over and over again. The puppy gets better and better at understanding and responding to you. The computer brain also keeps learning and improving. It gets better at understanding and answering questions, and even at doing new things that it wasn't specifically taught!\n\nSo, training a big computer brain is like teaching a puppy, but with lots and lots of examples, and instead of treats, the computer brain gets little rewards that help it learn and improve.

Introduction**\n\n*   **Gemini Family:** Gemini 1.5 Pro is presented as the latest model in the Gemini family, emphasizing its compute efficiency and multimodal capabilities.\n*   **Key Capabilities:** The model is designed for:\n    *   Recalling and reasoning over fine-grained information from millions of tokens of context.\n    *   Handling long documents, hours of video, and audio.\n    *   Achieving near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks.\n    *   Improving state-of-the-art performance in long-document QA, long-video QA, and long-context ASR.\n    *   Matching or surpassing Gemini 1.0 Ultra's performance on a broad set of benchmarks.\n*   **Context Length:** The model demonstrates continued improvement in next-token prediction and near-perfect retrieval ( >99%) up to at least 10M tokens.\n*   **In-Context Learning:** The model exhibits surprising new capabilities, such as learning to translate English to Kalamang (a low-resource language) at a similar level to a person who learned from the same content.\n\n**2. Model Architecture**\n\n*   **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE):** Gemini 1.5 Pro utilizes a sparse MoE architecture, building upon Gemini 1.0's research advances and multimodal capabilities.\n*   **Conditional Computation:** MoE models use a learned routing function to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters for processing. This allows the model to grow its total parameter count while keeping the number of activated parameters constant for any given input.\n*   **Transformer-Based:** The model is based on the Transformer architecture, which has become the standard for language models due to its ability to handle long-range dependencies.\n\n**3. Training Infrastructure and Dataset**\n\n*   **TPUv4 Accelerators:** Gemini 1.5 Pro is trained on multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators, distributed across multiple datacenters.\n*   **Multimodal and Multilingual Data:** The pre-training dataset includes data sourced from various domains, including web documents, code, images, audio, and video content.\n*   **Instruction Tuning:** The model is fine-tuned on a collection of multimodal data containing paired instructions and appropriate responses, with further tuning based on human preference data.\n\n**4. Long-Context Evaluation**\n\n*   **Evaluation Categories:** The evaluation of Gemini 1.5 Pro focuses on three main categories:\n    *   Qualitative long-context multimodal evaluations: Manually probing and stress-testing the model's long-context abilities.\n    *   Quantitative long-context multimodal evaluations: Measuring the model's long-context abilities on synthetic and real-world tasks with well-defined metrics.\n    *   Quantitative core evaluations: Identifying progress and regression in core capabilities.\n*   **Diagnostic Long-Context Evaluations:**\n    *   **Perplexity over Long Sequences:** Evaluating the ability of the models to make use of very long contexts to improve next-token prediction by recording the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of tokens at different positions in the input sequences.\n    *   **Text Haystack:** Testing long-context recall using the needle-in-a-haystack evaluation, which tests a model's ability to retrieve a text (i.e., \"needle\") inserted at various positions into a sequence (i.e., \"haystack\").\n    *   **Video Haystack:** Adapting the text needle-in-a-haystack evaluation and turning it into a cross-modal evaluation, wherein a needle is hidden in one modality while the retrieval query is given in text.\n    *   **Audio Haystack:** Testing long context capabilities on audio understanding by hiding a very short clip of audio lasting a few seconds where a speaker says \"the secret keyword is needle\" within an audio signal (the haystack) up to almost five days long (i.e., 107 hours).\n    *   **Improved Diagnostics:**\n        *   Multiple needles-in-haystack: Increasing the number of unique \"needles\" in each haystack and requiring the model to retrieve them all.\n        *   Multi-round Co-reference Resolution (MRCR): Presenting the model with a long conversation between a user and a model, in which the user requests writing (e.g. poems, riddles, essays) on different topics proceeded by the model responses.\n*   **Realistic Long-Context Evaluations:**\n    *   **In-Context Language Learning:** Evaluating Gemini 1.5 Pro on the Machine Translation from One Book (MTOB) benchmark, which measures the ability to learn to perform sentence-level translation between English and Kalamang (ISO 639-3 language code: kgv) from instructional materials.\n    *   **Long-Document QA:** Creating questions using the book \"Les Misérables\" (by Victor Hugo) and testing the model's ability to answer them correctly when the entire 1,462 page book (i.e., 710K tokens) is provided as input.\n    *   **Long-Context Audio:** Evaluating Gemini 1.5 Pro's long context understanding capabilities on audio inputs by testing it on 15 minute segments of an internal YouTube video-based benchmark.\n    *   **Long-Context Video QA:** Introducing a new benchmark, 1H-VideoQA, composed of 125 five-way multiple-choice questions over public videos 40-105 minutes long.\n\n**5. Core Capability Evaluations**\n\n*   **Core Text Evals:**\n    *   Reasoning, Math and Science\n    *   Coding\n    *   Multilinguality\n    *   Instruction Following\n*   **Core Vision Multimodal Evaluations:** Assessing performance on multimodal image tasks by reporting results on 8 image understanding benchmarks and 5 video understanding benchmarks.\n*   **Core Audio Multimodal Evaluations:** Evaluating Gemini 1.5 Pro on several short-context Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Automatic Speech Translation (AST) benchmarks.\n\n**6. Responsible Deployment**\n\n*   **Structured Approach:** Following a structured approach to responsible deployment, as outlined in Figure 13.\n*   **Impact Assessment:** Developing model impact assessments to identify, assess, and document key downstream societal benefits and harms associated with the development of advanced models.\n*   **Model Mitigations:** Modeling mitigation of safety risks mostly through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) using a reward model.\n*   **Model Safety Evaluations:** Undertaking a range of safety evaluations on the Gemini 1.5 Pro model, including content safety, representational harms, and memorization for text-to-text and image-to-text evaluations.\n*   **Divergence:** Evaluating Gemini 1.5 Pro to understand its susceptibility to divergence and in particular, emitting memorized training data via this attack.\n*   **Deployment:** Releasing external model cards on an ongoing basis within updates of technical reports and in documentation for enterprise customers.\n\n**Key Technical Details and Implications**\n\n*   **MoE Architecture:** The use of a Mixture-of-Experts architecture is crucial for scaling the model's capacity without a proportional increase in computational cost. This allows Gemini 1.5 Pro to have a much larger parameter count than a dense model with similar computational requirements.\n*   **Long Context Length:** The ability to process millions of tokens of context is a significant advancement. This enables the model to perform tasks that were previously impossible, such as analyzing entire books or long videos in a single pass.\n*   **Multimodal Capabilities:** The model's native multimodal capabilities allow it to seamlessly integrate information from different modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video. This is essential for tasks that require understanding the relationships between different types of data.\n*   **Instruction Tuning:** The use of instruction tuning is critical for aligning the model's behavior with human preferences and ensuring that it can follow complex instructions.\n*   **Responsible AI:** The paper emphasizes the importance of responsible AI development and deployment, including impact assessments, safety evaluations, and mitigation strategies.\n\n**In summary, Gemini 1.5 Pro represents a significant step forward in the development of large language models. Its MoE architecture, long context length, multimodal capabilities, and responsible AI approach make it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications.**\n\n-----"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"Rating: 5\n\nExplanation:\nThe response is excellent because it summarizes all the relevant details in the original text.

For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n\nOne reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n\nImproving confidence\nOne way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to reduce error, except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.","metadata":{}}]}
